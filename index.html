              </p>
              <p>
              The Simulation class runs the entire experiment of 5 to 100 people in Trial groups incremented by 5. The Birthday class deals with
              the random creation for birthdays for each person in the trial. The Trial class creates and runs the trial of a certain amount of
              people in a group. The Experiment class runs each trial once, tracking how many trials have found the same birthdays.
              </p>
              <p>
              I implemented the Simulation, Trial, and Experiment classes as well as testing for Trial and Experiment. I focused on writing
              clean code and efficient tests for this project.

                Motivation of the project:

              <p>
                In this elevator simulator, you will have different types of elevators that service the building. Each elevator will
                have different behaviors that it follows. You will also have a scheduler that will help to determine what elevator goes
                to service a call. To simplify the task, each call will tell you what floor it is coming from and what floor it would
                like to go to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Project design
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this simulator, I practiced using Test-Driven design, creating tests before implementing any code which allowed for
                more efficient code. While designing, we created interfaces for similar objects, like all Elevators and Schedulers, to make
                them uniform in how they run and are organized. The helper methods came more into play as I realized the Single Responsibility
                Rule was followed in each method.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the main lessons that stemmed from this project was time management and the importance of starting early. It's very
                easy to get behind in how many implementations and tests that are needed to be completed.

              <p>Spring 2025</p>
              <p>Description</p>
              <p>
                Timely is an interactive app aimed at helping you organize events and tasks in a planner. Timely provides users with an
                interactive and simple calendar view that lets them keep track of events, whether they are considered all-day events or
                time blocks. At the same time, the unique design of Timely allows the user to keep track of various tasks throughout the
                day, and as they work towards completing these tasks, they are met with a visually reactive progress chart. The progress
                chart is a unique feature that keeps you on top of all your work and visualizes your successes through our application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Motivation
              </p>
              <p>
                Time management is a skill I have been working on improving for a long time to balance my personal and school life.
                Throughout my college career I have tried multiple planners, phyical and online versions, and I haven't come across an
                application that has all the features I am looking for. This sparked the idea of creating my own planner that includes
                everything in one app that I can use daily.
              </p>
              <p>
                Project design
              </p>
              <p>
                For the back-end we followed the Model View Controller (MVC) Design Pattern including the Observer and Facade Patterns so the entire planner
                updates orderly and automatically across the different components. The Planner view encompasses all views of the
                Calendar where one can add different events either All-Day or a Time Block, To Do List which is a running list of
                personal or school tasks notably different by the colors of the text, and Progress Chart which tracks the percentage of
                how many tasks have been completed. We used inheritance properties of interfaces and abstract classes to implement
                concrete objects that the different components are based off of.
              </p>
              <p>
                Implementation
              </p>
              <p>
                My partner and I aimed to follow Object-Oriented principles and we learned in class. Because
                we are a two-person team, we wanted to ensure we had a workload that was feasible to complete by the due date. Between the 
                two of us, we divided the work by components. I implemented the To Do List and Progress Chart and brought it altogether for 
                a code clean up ensuring all lines of code were used and relevant in the program. Building UI and using the MVC pattern to 
                build an interactive application was new to me and I enjoyed seeing it come into fruition.
